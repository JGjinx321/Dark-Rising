		Joseph wakes up to a dark room. A single big back t.v. is loudly 
		playing the 6 o'clock news. Joseph looks over at his digital clock through
		a fuzzy blur of just waking up. The red symbols display a time of 6:46 p.m. 
		Joseph remembers passing out on the couch from an exhausting day at work. He
		groggily sits upright on his couch and reaches for the remote to turn the tv
		screen. "Heads of state are saying stay inside. Lock your doors, turn off 
		any unnecessary lights, and try to keep noise to a minimal." The news anchor
		continues in her frantic tone. "They highly advise all residents to stay away
		from the outdoors and to try and keep any devices charged to receive 
		regular updates from your head of state in case of emergency.". "Do not 
		under any circumstance try and interact with the infected." If there is 
		anyone you know who may be infected quarantine them imme-." The t.v. cuts 
		off. Joseph begins to worry. He gets up and with a quickened pace and walks 
		over to his window facing the street. Joseph peaks out behind his blinds and 
		notices sparks shooting out from a cut power line whipping in the darkness
		on his blackout street. In the distance Joseph hears car engines roaring up
		and down streets and a single voice in the distance screaming what sounds 
		like "Hurry!"
